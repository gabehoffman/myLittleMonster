# myLittleMonster
Feed the 8-bit monster or it will die. The monster has two needs, it needs love and it needs food. Drag the heart or the food to the monster to keep it healthy. If you don't, the monster will lose a life. After three skulls, you'll see the monster crumple to the floor.

Uses animation, listeners and timers.
